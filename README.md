# MIcroservice-Deployment
CI/CD with GitHub Actions: Deploying a Docker Compose App on AWS EC2



# What Youâ€™ll Learn

1) What are micro-services?

2) How to deploy a micro-service app using Docker (Docker Compose) locally

3) Automating the deployment process to an EC2 instance using CI/CD with GitHub Actions



# Project Goals

Containerize a multiâ€‘service web app (Vote â†’ Redis â†’ Worker â†’ Postgres â†’ Result).

Run locally via Docker Compose.

Push images to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) or Docker Hub.

Autoâ€‘deploy to AWS EC2 using GitHub Actions over SSH.


# ðŸ§± Architecture

[ vote (Flask) ] -> [ redis ]

[ worker (.NET) ] -> [ redis, db ]

[ result (Node) ] -> [ db ]

vote writes to redis

worker drains redis â†’ persists to postgres

result reads tallies from postgres
